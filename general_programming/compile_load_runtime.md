Compile time: Once you have done writing your program(whatever the programming languages). You will do compile/build to find any error in your code. while doing compile or build, the compiler check for syntax errors. Some static values and object creation can also be taken place during compile time.

load time: Once you get successful compilation. you will run the program to get your preferred output. to do so, you have to run the program, to run, you need to have some room(memory). how much time your program require to load into memory to get preferred output called load time.

load time various depends on the datatypes you used. to avoid over load time, you need to remove duplicate code, use appropriate datatypes for the variables, take care of memory leaks(ex: stack overflow exception) and all will improve the load time.

run time: once the program loaded into the memory, based on your code the values may assign to variable or object creation can be done and also you will get your preferred output if your logic is right?.

If you're IDE is an interpreter you will get your compile time error simultaneously or else you will get at the compile time.
