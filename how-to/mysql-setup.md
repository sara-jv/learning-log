So, what is MySQL? It is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), and a RDBMS us just a piece of software that makes doing database things easier, and in this case, doing things to a SQL database. There are other flavors of RDBMS, some I'm sure you've heard of, like: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MariaDB, SQLite ... (you get the idea).

Whaaaaat is SQL you ask? Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. W3 has a nice primer here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp and Oracle has everything you need to know: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Introduction-to-Oracle-SQL.html#GUID-049B7AE8-11E1-4110-B3E4-D117907D77AC. 

Ok but what is a *relational database?* Relational databases are all SQL based, and store data in tabular format with rows and columns (think an Excel spreadsheet).  On the other hand, non-relational databases have a variety of systems. 
- Key/Value
- Document
- Graph 

I'll write something on these later. For now, thats all you need to know.
