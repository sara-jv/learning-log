# React Native
## What is it?
Open-source frameworke created by facebook to build native applications using js. A native application is a software program developers build for use on a particular platform or device. RN removes the need to learn IoS/Android specific programming paradigms, since the code can be shared between the two platforms. 

**Pros:**
- Don't need to hire two subsets of devs for iOS (Swift, Objective-C) and Android (Java, Kotlin)
- Faster time to market
- Hot reloading vs. w/native development you must compile your code to see the changes, depending on size of app, can take up to a minute.
