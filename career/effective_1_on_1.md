### Why care?

This really resonated with me:
```
Out of fear, anxiety, and a bit of dread for what the conversation was going to be like, I pushed my impending one-on-one meeting out of mind. I didn’t think about what I wanted to say in the weeks (and days) leading up to it. “
``` 

I'd like to not feel afraid of one-on-ones. Here are some notes on how to make those meetings more effective and less scary.

I want to look forward to my 1:1 meetings, its an opportunity for:
1. Feedback
2. Coaching
3. Rapport building
4. And talking about all the things important to you that seem to always slip your mind.

### Tips
- Avoid status updates
  - Thats what standup should be used for. 

Bring what you want to talk about by creating an agenda. Ideas for your agendar include:
1. Your Career/Growth Goals: If you have an aspiration, don't assume your manager knows it. Bring it up.
   1.  This is the perfect time to bring up any skills you want to improve on, new things you want to learn about, or a new role you aspire to.
   2.  Your manager likely knows about opportunities in the company that you don't. If you make your career and skills growth part of your 1 on 1 meetings, they're much more likely to recognize a role you could fit when openings come up.
2. Team Improvement: Have ideas to help the team improve, or work better? Effective 1 on 1 meetings are a great time to discuss them and either come up with ways to apply them or understand why you can't do them.
3. Self Improvement: Want help, feedback, or coaching on something? Ask! By specifically asking, your manager is more likely to be able to carve out time to help and provide feedback in that area.
4. Personal Topics: Is there something personal they should know about? Like a family death, sickness, stress at home, etc? Letting them know about things that affect your work can help them have more empathy for you and open up the potential for reasonable accommodations.
5. Interpersonal Issues: Having problems with a coworker? Your manager can help mediate or coach you through how to deal with the issue.
