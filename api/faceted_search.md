## Faceted Search

## What is it?
- Faceted search is also called faceted browsing, faceted navigation, guided navigation and sometimes parametric search.
- Faceted search is the dynamic clustering of items or search results into categories that let users drill into search results (or even skip searching entirely) by any value in any field. 
- Each facet displayed also shows the number of hits within the search that match that category

Examples:
```
Manufacturer:
- Manu1 (2)
- Manu2 (12)
- Manu3 (5)
```
Manufacturer would be a facet, and the values for this facet would be Manu1, Manu2, and Manu3.

#### Summary
Faceted (or navigational) search uses a hierarchy structure (taxonomy) to enable users to browse information by choosing from a pre-determined set of categories. This allows a user to type in their simple query, then refine their search options by navigating/drilling down. In reality, it's an advanced search going on in the background, but instead of the user having to think of the additional search categories, it's been made easier for them by the visible folder structure. Examples of this are eCommerce sites like Amazon and eBay.
