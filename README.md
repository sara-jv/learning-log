This repo documents all of the tidbits and topics I've learned by searching on the web, reading and experimenting. Inspired by my senior dev, who encouraged me to "read voraciously and absorb as much as possible".

I'm still trying to figure out the right mechanism to remind myself to document and push something more often than once in a blue moon.
