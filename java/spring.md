## Okay, what the hell is Spring/Spring MVC/Spring Boot
In a very condensed nutshell:
- **Spring** is an umbrella project for many many libraries, all of which derive from Spring Core.
-  **Spring Core** is a dependency injection framework for Java. It is the foundation for other various frameworks in the Spring family.  Understand this or nothing else will make sense.
- **Spring MVC** is a web app framework built on top of Spring Core and Java Servlet API. It leverages the Model - View - Controller architecture (hence the name). Learn after Spring Core. 
- **Spring Boot** is another framework from this family for building web apps with less manual configurations and in less time.
