Junit
JUnit is a framework that helps with writing and running your unit tests.

Mockito
Mockito (or any other mocking tool) is a framework that you specifically use to efficiently write tests using the `mocking` approach. 

Any mocking framework allows you omit instantiating "real" objects of production classes, instead the mocking framework creates a stub for you. Doing so gives you full control over that mocked object and enables you to verify the interactions taking place for example.
